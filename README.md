concrete5 Boilerplate
=====================

A basic starting point for [concrete5](http://www.concrete5.org/r/-/654) packages, 
with samples of code you might use. This is not intended for production, it does 
not do anything useful by itself.

But if you want to learn about how packages work, and save time when you develop 
your own sites, this is something that can help you out a lot.

How to Use This Package
-----------------------

The intended for people that are developing custom sites more than people that 
are developing for the marketplace. So instead of locally adding a page type,
then adding some attributes via the gui, then having to recreate that whole
process on the live server, you have everything in one package. 

When trying to find your custom templates for blocks, themes, etc, it's also much
nicer to do everything in a package. If you need a new attribute or block, you can
just put that into your upgrade script.
